## 🎯 Next Steps (Not in this PR)

1. **Screen 2: Company Research** - Perplexity AI integration for company intelligence
2. **Screen 3: Copy Lab** - AI copy synthesis and real-time assembly
3. **Screen 4: Outbound Configuration** - Pre-flight checks and domain setup
4. **Screen 5: Confirm & Launch** - Campaign review and launch

## 💡 Key Decisions

1. **Used Supabase over raw PostgreSQL** - For built-in auth and RLS
2. **shadcn/ui over Material-UI** - Better customization, smaller bundle
3. **Company autocomplete uses Google Favicon API** - Free, reliable, no API key needed
4. **Brand kit CSS variables** - Easy theming and dark mode support
5. **TypeScript strict mode** - Better type safety and developer experience

## 🚀 Deployment

Ready to deploy to Vercel:
1. Connect repository to Vercel
2. Add environment variables
3. Deploy

## 📝 Notes

- All code follows Next.js 14 App Router best practices
- Components are client-side where needed ('use client')
